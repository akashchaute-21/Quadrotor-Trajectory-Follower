# Quadrotor-Trajectory-Follower
Firstly, We Learned about the Basics of Control Theory. Then moved to PID Controller, what are proportional, integral and derivative gains.
## PID Controller
Here calculation of K~p~, K~i~, K~d~ is a main task. For this we learned 2 methods: firstly, the trial and error method, in which a knowledge of change in proportional, integral and derivative when either 1 or 2 or all of the 3 change is required. The other method is Zeigler-Nicholas Method. (In our project we usde trial and error method)
A detailed report of the assignment for tuning of PID Controller can be found on: https://hackmd.io/@akkaash/Hk6aaleBY 
This assignment helped to know the how the parameters change by changing either of K~p~(proportional gain), K~i~(integral gain) or K~d~(derivative gain).
